\usage{
glr(g, type = "md", testSlope = 0)

plr(vf, type = "td", testSlope = 0)

poplr(vf, type = "td", testSlope = 0, nperm = factorial(7), trunc = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{global indices}

\item{type}{type of analysis. For \code{glr}, it can be `\code{ms}`, `\code{ss}`,
`\code{md}`, `\code{sd}`, `\code{pmd}`, `\code{psd}`, `\code{vfi}`, or `\code{gh}`
  for mean sensitivity, standard deviation of sensitivities, mean deviation,
  standard deviation of total deviation values, pattern mean deviation, pattern
  standard deviation, VFI, and general height, respectively. For \code{plr} and
  \code{poplr}, it can be `\code{s}`, `\code{td}`, or `\code{pd}` for sensitivities,
  total deviation values, or pattern deviation values, respectively}

\item{testSlope}{slope, or slopes, to test as null hypothesis. Default is 0.
if a single value, then the same null hypothesis is used for all locations.
If a vector of values, then (for \code{plr} and \code{poplr}) each
location of the visual field will have a different null hypothesis. The length of
testSlope must be 1 or equal to the number of locations to be used in the PLR or
PoPLR analysis}

\item{vf}{visual fields sensitivity data}

\item{nperm}{number of permutations. If the number of visits is 7 or less, then
\code{nperm = factorial(nrow(vf))}. For series greater than 8 visits, default is
factorial(7)}

\item{trunc}{truncation value for the Truncated Product Method (see reference)}

\description{
Functions that compute global and pointwise linear regression analyses:
\itemize{
  \item\code{glr} performs global linear regression analysis
  \item\code{plr} performs pointwise linear regression (PLR) analysis
  \item\code{poplr} performs PoPLR analysis as in O'Leary et al (see reference)
}
}
\details{
\itemize{
  \item\code{poplr} there is a small difference between this implementation of
    PoPLR and that proposed by O'Leary et al. The combined S statistic in the
    paper used a natural logarithm. Here we not only use a logarithm of base 10
    but we also divide by the number of locations. This way the S statistic has
    a more direct interpretation as the average number of leading zeros in the
    p-values for pointwise (simple) linear regression. That is, if S = 2, then
    the p-values have on average 2 leading zeros, if S = 3, then 3 leading zeros,
    and so on
