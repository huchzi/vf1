vfctrIowaPeri
}
\description{
Locations of the visual field tested have eccentricities from 26
to up to 81 degrees and were obtained with a custom static automated perimetry.
Data are from 98 eyes of 98 ocular healthy subjects. Each subject underwent two
visual field tests, one of the central visual field (64 locations within 26 degrees
of fixation) and one of the peripheral visual field (64 locations with eccentricity
from 26 to up to 81 degrees)
}
\details{
Data are for locations with eccentricity from 26 to up to 81 degrees.
The dataset for locations within the central 26 degrees are in \code{\link{vfctrIowaPC26}}.
This dataset of healthy eyes was used to generate the normative values
\code{iowa_Peri_pw}, and \code{iowa_Peri_pw_cps} included in \code{\link{normvals}}.
